Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "move_file: Move or rename files and directories. Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation. If the destination exists, the operation will fail. Works across different directories and can be used for simple renaming within the same directory. Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n",
      "search_files: Recursively search for files and directories matching a pattern. Searches through all subdirectories from the starting path. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. Returns full paths to all matching items. Great for finding files when you don't know their exact location. Only searches within allowed directories.\n",

The recipe includes instructions for making dulce de leche from sweetened condensed milk in the oven, which is considered safer than boiling the can. It's a quick and easy dessert that can be made ahead of time, though the bananas are best added closer to serving to prevent browning.\n",

      "*   **Crust:**\n",
      "    *   1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs\n",

      "    *   6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted\n",
      "*   **Filling:**\n",
      "    *   1 and 1/4 cups dulce de leche\n",

      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Make the crust:** Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press firmly into a 9-inch pie dish. Bake for 15 minutes, then cool.\n",
      "2.  **Make Dulce de Leche (if not using store-bought):** Pour sweetened condensed milk into a pie dish. Place in a larger roasting pan and fill with hot water halfway up the pie dish. Loosely cover with foil. Bake at 350°F (177°C) for about 2 hours, adding more water if needed, until thickened and caramelized. Let cool.\n",
      "3.  **Assemble the pie:** Spread dulce de leche over the cooled crust. Arrange sliced bananas on top of the dulce de leche.\n",
      "4.  **Make whipped cream:** Whip cold heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form (3-4 minutes).\n",
      "5.  **Top the pie:** Spread whipped cream over the bananas.\n",
      "6.  **Chill:** Refrigerate uncovered for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Garnish before serving if desired.\n",
      "7.  **Store:** Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   Dulce de leche can be made up to 2 weeks in advance.\n",
      "*   To prevent bananas from browning, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice on them before adding to the pie.\n",
      "*   Digestive biscuits can be substituted for graham crackers.\n",
