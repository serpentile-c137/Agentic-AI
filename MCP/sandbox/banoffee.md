**Banoffee Pie Recipe Summary**

This no-bake Banoffee Pie features a simple graham cracker crust, a layer of dulce de leche, sliced bananas, and a generous topping of homemade whipped cream. The recipe includes instructions for making dulce de leche from sweetened condensed milk in the oven, which is considered safer than boiling the can. It's a quick and easy dessert that can be made ahead of time, though the bananas are best added closer to serving to prevent browning.

**Ingredients:**

*   **Crust:**
    *   1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs
    *   1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
    *   6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted
*   **Filling:**
    *   1 and 1/4 cups dulce de leche
    *   2 large bananas, sliced
*   **Whipped Cream:**
    *   2 cups (480ml) cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream
    *   1/4 cup confectioners' sugar or granulated sugar
    *   1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
*   **Optional toppings:** chocolate shavings, chopped nuts, or toffee bits

**Instructions:**

1.  **Make the crust:** Preheat oven to 350째F (177째C). Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press firmly into a 9-inch pie dish. Bake for 15 minutes, then cool.
2.  **Make Dulce de Leche (if not using store-bought):** Pour sweetened condensed milk into a pie dish. Place in a larger roasting pan and fill with hot water halfway up the pie dish. Loosely cover with foil. Bake at 350째F (177째C) for about 2 hours, adding more water if needed, until thickened and caramelized. Let cool.
3.  **Assemble the pie:** Spread dulce de leche over the cooled crust. Arrange sliced bananas on top of the dulce de leche.
4.  **Make whipped cream:** Whip cold heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form (3-4 minutes).
5.  **Top the pie:** Spread whipped cream over the bananas.
6.  **Chill:** Refrigerate uncovered for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day. Garnish before serving if desired.
7.  **Store:** Cover and store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

**Notes:**

*   Dulce de leche can be made up to 2 weeks in advance.
*   To prevent bananas from browning, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice on them before adding to the pie.
*   Digestive biscuits can be substituted for graham crackers.
*   The assembled pie does not freeze well, but leftover slices can be frozen.
